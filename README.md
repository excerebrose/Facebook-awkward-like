# Facebook Awkward Like

We have all been in the situation - either drunk or sober where we have gone so far into someone's profile
that we know what they wore for their 5th birthday, or their uncle's wedding, all is going well until one slipe and...

*click* Liked *gasp*

The awkward situation where you don't know whether to unlike quickly so that they don't get a notification, or have they seen it already?

Well worry not, Like Button Blocker is here.
Simply download the extension from the Google extension store, and disable the ability to like in one-click! (Hah, see what I did there?)

## Steps to run:
To load your extension in Chrome, open up chrome://extensions/ in your browser and click “Developer mode” in the top right. Now click “Load unpacked extension…” and select the extension’s directory. You should now see your extension in the list.
